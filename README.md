This will be explanation on how to access these debug rooms that I have personally added myself. Note: It is kind scuffed the way I added them.

The general gist I did to access them: 

# Map003.json (CC1's Debug Room)
I copied the code for BB's Finale Restroom interaction and added it CC1's restroom map under a new event. I then slightly changed it so that when you interact with him enough times and you access the Hidden Room, instead of taking you there, you get sent to the Debug room instead. This is only for CC1's Restroom and not other iterations of it.
# Map028.json (CC2's Debug Room)
For CC2, I added a new event that made Toy Freddy teleport into the debug when when he goes into the presents for naughty adults in the Show Stage area (somehow). This means you won't interact with the presents anymore, but that'll be how you get into the debug room.
# Map051.json (CC3's Debug Character)
For CC3, I changed a piece of code with how Shattered Masculinity Toy Freddy appears and replaced it with Phantom B.B.'s code on how he appears. Just like Phantom B.B., if you've defeated the Alpha enemies in Cam 08 at the start of the game, he'll appear. You can also interact with this debug character on Act 2 too.

# Installation
Just add these files into the data folder of your www folder and replace them.
